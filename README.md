Secret Santa Email Automation Script

This Secret Santa script is a Python-based solution for automating the pairing and email notification process in a Secret Santa game. 
It is designed to handle participant input, randomly assign Secret Santa pairs, and send customized email notifications using the Mailjet API.

Key Challenges and Solutions:
- Random Pairing Logic: Implemented an algorithm to ensure random, non-repeating pairings.
- Email Automation: Integrated with Mailjet API for reliable email delivery.
- User Input Handling: Developed an interactive console application to collect participant data.

#### Technical Overview
The script is written in Python 3 and utilizes standard libraries for its operations. 
The pairing algorithm uses the `random` library to ensure fairness, and the `mailjet_rest` library is used for email operations. 
The script maintains data integrity and ensures that each participant is both a giver and a receiver.

# Installation
Requires Python 3.x. Dependencies can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install mailjet_rest
```

#### Usage

To run the script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter participant details. The script will then automatically handle the pairing and send emails.

#### Configuration
Set up your Mailjet API keys as environment variables for security:
```bash
export MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC='your_public_api_key'
export MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE='your_private_api_key'
```

#### How it works

The script starts by collecting participant information through the console.
It then shuffles the participants and assigns each a unique receiver using a circular pairing algorithm.
For each pairing, an email is constructed using a predefined HTML template, personalized with the receiver's details.
The Mailjet API is then used to send these emails, with error handling to ensure reliable delivery.
